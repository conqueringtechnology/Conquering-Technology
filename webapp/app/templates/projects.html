                            This website is my first ever project, such as learning what is a HTML tag to learning functions in JavaScript. The project started when I wanted to show my family and friends in California and Mexico, my newborn son Michael and what he was doing and how he was grown. Through time the website expanded to include my family. Each member of my family has a section on the website. I update Michael’s section often to showcase videos, pictures, and his schoolwork. The website is responsive.

                            This is a project management document for an user account system for a online game. This project document outlines the proposal for an online tabletop trading card game that will be developed. Gaming online is exploding, and the team will leverage the power of replicating the tactile and social aspects of strategic tabletop gaming while enhancing it with digital advantages like immersive online gameplay experience, accessibility, and convenience. Maverick Analyzers (class team name)will focus on having a secure, user friendly, and strong user account system that allows users to create an account, login, logout, reset forgotten password, access their profile page, edit profile page, view home page, and about page. Having a well-developed user account system is important to the success and the trustworthiness of the game. Maverick Analyzers will collaborate closely with our clients and partners to ensure that the account system meets their needs and exceeds their expectations. Maverick Analyzers will continue updating documents to provide up to date analysis. We will provide the design documentation to give the client a detailed overview of the context, flow, and functionality of the user account system.

                            Ensuring Cybersecurity in Connected Autonomous Vehicles annotation bibliography dives into the cybersecurity of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). CAVs are set to revolutionize transportation by improving efficiency and accessibility. They can communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, operating without user intervention. While significant progress has been made in their development, CAVs face challenges in cybersecurity. They are vulnerable to diverse cyber-attacks, including those targeting electronic systems, communication networks, software, and data. To ensure their safety, it is essential to maintain a robust defense mechanism against cyber threats. Research has focused on identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities and developing countermeasures to mitigate potential cyber threats against CAVs. The ongoing development of proactive measures and novel protection tactics is crucial for addressing the complex and dynamic cybersecurity issues that CAVs face in the real world. The security challenges associated with CAVs must be thoroughly understood and addressed to support their safe and secure integration into the transportation ecosystem. Several peer-reviewed sources provide in-depth information about CAV vulnerabilities, cyberattacks against CAVs, and the challenges they face in cybersecurity, offering valuable resources for understanding and addressing these issues.
